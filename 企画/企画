# Game Design Document (The Soul)
**Title**: ZERO DISTANCE
**Genre**: Top-down Counter Action (Arena)
**Concept**: "Enter the Dead Zone to Kill." (High Risk, High Return)

This document defines the **CORE FUN** and **GAMEPLAY RULES**.
All mechanics must serve the "Risk and Return" philosophy.

---

## 1. Core Loop
The game loop consists of 5 steps:
1.  **Lure**: Player enters their own "Kill Circle" (Aura) to invite enemies.
2.  **Risk**: Wait for the enemy to start an attack (Telegraph).
3.  **Action**: Dodge exactly when the enemy's hitbox is active.
4.  **Reward**: **"Just Dodge"** triggers, slowing down time. Counter-attack becomes available.
5.  **Growth**: Pick up higher quality weapons (Auto-Upgrade) without stopping.

## 2. Player Mechanics
-   **Movement**: WASD / Left Stick. Fast and responsive.
-   **Kill Circle (The Aura)**:
    -   Visual: A faint, dark particle/shader aura around the player.
    -   Function: Represents the "Counter Range".
-   **Just Dodge Logic (Crucial)**:
    -   Condition A: Enemy is inside the "Kill Circle".
    -   Condition B: Enemy is currently `ATTACKING` (Active Hitbox).
    -   Trigger: Player presses `DODGE` button while A and B are true.
    -   Result: **Global Slow Motion** (Time Scale 0.1 for 0.5s) + Screen Flash.

## 3. Enemy Design (Melee Only)
-   **Fairness**: No sudden instant hits.
    -   **Telegraph Phase**: 0.5s warning (Flash/Wind-up).
    -   **Attack Phase**: 0.2s duration (The active hitbox window).
-   **Behavior**:
    -   Enemies crowd around the player but do not overlap (Separation force).
    -   No projectiles (Guns). Pure melee spacing game.

## 4. Weapon System (Flow State)
-   **No Inventory Management**:
    -   Weapons have no durability.
    -   **Auto-Loot**: If a dropped weapon has a higher `Quality Tier` than the current one, it is automatically equipped upon collision.
    -   Benefit: Player never stops moving to check stats.

## 5. Game Feel (Sakurai Philosophy)
-   **Static vs Dynamic**: The game is quiet until a Just Dodge occurs. Then it explodes with sound and visual distortion.
-   **Hit Stop**: Every successful hit freezes the frame for 0.1s to convey "Weight".
-   **Visuals**: Dark arena, Neon entities. High contrast for visibility.
